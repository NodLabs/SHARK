## Running ESRGAN

```
1. ./setup_esrgan.sh
2. Keep the images to be restored in `InputImages` directory created by the script in step 1.
3. python esrgan.py
```


- The script aims to also download [RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17VYV_SoZZesU6mbxz2dMAIccSSlqLecY) and places it in the `models` directory.
